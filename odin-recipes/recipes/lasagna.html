    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>A baked Italian dish consisting of wide strips of pasta cooked and layered with meat or vegetables, cheese, and tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic </li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning </li>
        <li>1 cup spaghetti sauce </li>
        <li>6 purchased precooked or oven-ready lasagna noodles (each about 7x3 inches)</li>
        <li>1 container (12 ounces) reduced-fat cottage cheese (1 1/2 cups) </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces) </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400Â°. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Cook the beef and garlic in the skillet over medium heat about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beef is brown; drain. </li>
        <li>Stir the Italian seasoning and spaghetti sauce into the beef. Spread 1/4 cup of the beef mixture in the ungreased square pan. </li>
        <li>Top with 2 noodles, placing them so they do not overlap or touch the sides of the pan because they will expand as they bake. Spread about 1-2 cup of the remaining beef mixture over the noodles. </li>
        <li>Spread about 1/2 cup of the cottage cheese over the beef mixture. Sprinkle with about 1/3 cup of the mozzarella cheese. </li>
        <li>Repeat layering twice more, beginning with 2 more noodles and following directions in steps 3 and 4 Sprinkle with the parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes. Carefully remove the foil, and continue baking about 10 minutes longer or until lasagna is bubbly around the edges and looks very hot. Let stand 10 minutes, so the lasagna will become easier to cut and serve. </li>
    </ol>
